The study advances real-time bird detection in substation environment by integrating improvements within YOLOv5 framework. The improvement involves integrating MobileNetV3 into the backbone and applying an efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) mechanism to refine detection precision while maintaining speed. The aim is to achieve an efficient balance between rapid detection and high accuracy for bird monitoring tasks. Additionally, an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) is utilized to integrate features across different layers. Furthermore, the original loss function is replaced with Wise-IoU, which effectively improves the model recognition accuracy through the introduction of a dynamic gradient gain allocation strategy. Ultimately, our modifications were compared to the standard YOLOv5 model using a custom bird dataset, achieving effective improvements. The study reports an increase in mean average precision from 89.4% to 91.7%. Furthermore, the weight file decreased by 28% and the parameters decreased by 20%. These results demonstrate the enhanced efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, indicating its potential for real-time bird detection tasks.
