**Since my personal homepage was recently launched, some of the information on my template-based homepage is not yet complete. I will improve my personal homepage as soon as possible.**

# Summary
I am an undergraduate student at the **School of Artificial Intelligence, Southeast University (SEU)**.  
I have a solid grasp of academic knowledge from my coursework, while my research interests extend broadly outside the classroom. These include large language models, neural networks, contrastive learning, and unsupervised learning paradigms in machine learning.  
I enjoy exploring the unknown and excel in the practical application of technical skills. Beyond my studies and research, I have a strong passion for open-source projects and deeply value the collaborative spirit they embody.
