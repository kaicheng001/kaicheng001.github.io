## Summary

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.seu.edu.cn), 
[Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), with a strong focus on Computer Vision and Large Language Models. 
My academic pursuits are complemented by a broad interest in advanced machine learning techniques, 
including neural networks, contrastive learning, and unsupervised learning paradigms. 
I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions and applying technical skills to real-world problems. 
Additionally, I am deeply committed to open-source projects and the collaborative ethos they foster.
