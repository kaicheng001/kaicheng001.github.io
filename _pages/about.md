Xing Xie is currently a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence.

I am generally interested in computer vision and machine learning. My recent focus is on:
- Multimodal Large Language Model
- Generative Model

I enjoy exploring the unknown and excel in the practical application of technical skills. Beyond academia, I have a deep appreciation for open-source software and the collaborative spirit it fosters.
